			<h2>What we stand for:</h2>
			<p>
			ConfessionMate was created from a place of deep love for the Sacrament & for the people who struggle to approach it.<br><br>

			We know how hard it can be to come back to Confession. The nerves, the doubts, the not knowing where to start.<br><br>
			
			That‚Äôs why we built ConfessionMate: to be a simple, safe space for you to gather your thoughts, to reflect,
			and walk toward mercy without pressure, without judgement, and without anyone watching.<br><br>
			
			Nothing you write will ever be stored on a server or on your device, your confessions are encrypted with care and only readable by you.<br>
			Your confession is only between you and our all loving and merciful God.<br><br>
			
			On ConfessionMate you‚Äôll find: a virtual Rosary to pray, scripture for strength, helpful tips, and little reminders of God‚Äôs
			unfailing & never ending love.<br><br>
			
			And because we believe in community, we‚Äôve opened space for local businesses to share what they offer.
			Good honest work and good service, all close to home.<br><br>

			No sign-ups. No subscriptions. No ads. Ever.<br>
			Just a peaceful place to ready yourself for Gods mercy.<br><br>

			ConfessionMate will be free and open source until the end of time.<br>(A very long time from now, hopefully).<br><br>
			Whether you‚Äôre returning after years or preparing for the hundredth time, ConfessionMate is here to help you in the confessional.<br>
			Come as you are.
